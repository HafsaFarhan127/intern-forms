## Information sheet "Encouragement of home ownership via UBS vested benefits account"

## Tax aspects

An early withdrawal will result in the vested benefits being taxed in the year in which the withdrawal is made.

If the pension account holder lives abroad or will leave Switzerland within a short time, a withholding taxes shall be levied. If the Foundation has no consistent information about the domicile (e.g. P.O. Box or c/o-address) a withholding tax will be levied as well. The Vested Benefits Foundation shall deduct these taxes directly from the UBS vested benefits account before paying out the pension benefits. The net amount paid out may therefore differ from the originally requested amount.

In accordance with Art. 13 of the Ordinance on the Encouragement of the Use of Vested Pension Accruals for Home Ownership (hereinafter «WEFV»), the pension fund must report all early payouts of vested benefits and all repayments to the pension fund to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration using the relevant form within 30 days.

The Swiss Federal Tax Administration keeps account of the reported early withdrawals and repayments of early withdrawals. Upon written request from the pension account holder, it shall confirm the amount of the outstanding early withdrawals and indicate which authorities are responsible for reimbursing the taxes paid.

In the event of repayment of the advance withdrawal, the tax paid will be refunded excluding interest. In order for the taxes to be reimbursed, a written application must be sent to the authorities that levied the taxes. The pension account holder must submit a certificate authenticating the repayment of the pension capital invested in home ownership and of the taxes paid to the federal, cantonal and municipal authorities as a result of the early withdrawal (Art. 14 WEFV). Entitlement to reimbursement of the taxes paid shall expire three years after the early withdrawal has been repaid to the occupational pension plan (Art. 83a, para. 3 LPP).

## Ensuring proper use of the funds

In accordance with the law, the Vested Benefits Foundation is obliged to submit a selling restriction to be annotated in the appropriate Land Register. It must do so when it pays out the early withdrawal. A property with a selling restriction cannot be sold without the consent of the Vested Benefit Foundation or the pension fund. The selling restriction may be deleted:

- a) if the pension account holder is entitled to retirement benefits;
- b) if the pension account holder is entitled to pension benefits for another reason;
- c) if the vested benefits are paid out in cash or
- d) if it can be proved that the amount invested in residential property has been transferred to the account holder pension fund or to a vested benefits scheme.

Any land register fees must be paid by the property owner. The Vested Benefits Foundation of UBS AG will send the related invoice to the pension account holder.

If the pension account holder acquires shares in a cooperative housing association, he1 shall deposit these shares at the Vested Benefits Foundation to ensure the funds are used properly.

## Multiple withdrawals

According to Art. 5, para. 3 WEFV, withdrawals can be made every five years.

If the pension account holder wants to use the proceeds from the sale of a residential property in the amount of the early withdrawal to buy another residential property within two years, he may transfer this amount to a vested benefits scheme (Art. 30d, para. 4 LPP/BVG).

## Early withdrawal limits

On reaching 60 years of age, partial withdrawals for promoting home ownership are no longer permitted; only the full vested benefits may be paid out from this age upon reaching AVS/AHV retirement age. No further documentary proof is required for this payment reason. You are therefore kindly request that fill in, sign and return form "Payment application UBS vested benefits account" to the Foundation on reaching the age specified above.

Pursuant to Art. 30c, para. 2 LPP and Art. 5, para 4 WEFV the amount for a withdrawal is limited from the age of 50. The Foundation can provide closer information.

## Blocked amount resulting from pension fund purchases

If pension fund purchases have been made, Art. 79b para. 3 LPP Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivors' and Disability Plans states that the resulting benefits may not be withdrawn as a lump sum for the three years following the purchase. In addition, pursuant to Swiss Federal Court's jurisdiction, any lump-sum withdrawal within three years following the purchase can result in a denial or reversal of the tax deductibility.

## Repayment

According to Art. 30d, para. 1 LPP/BVG, the vested benefits being withdrawn must be repaid to the pension fund by the pension account holder or his heirs if:

a) the property is sold; b) rights are granted to the property that are equivalent to a sale in economic terms or c) no pension benefits are due upon the death of the pension account holder.

The pension account holder can repay the amount withdrawn at any time under the conditions of Art. 30d, para. 3 LPP/BVG. Such a repayment is permitted:

a) until the pension account holder is entitled to retirement benefits;

b) until the pension account holder is entitled to pension benefits for another reason or c) until the vested benefits are paid out in cash.

If the property is sold, the repayment obligation will be limited to the proceeds of the sale. The proceeds of the sale are considered to be the sale price minus the mortgage-backed loan and any fees the seller is legally required to pay (Art. 30d, para. 5 LPP/BVG).

## Realization of pledged assets

The provisions in this information sheet also apply to any realization of pledged assets.

Art. 8 WEFV relates to the pledge of vested benefits and defines under para. 1 the maximum pledgeable amount for the pension account holder under the age of 50. The pledge amount corresponds, up to the age of 50, to the vested benefits acquired at the time of the realization of the pledged assets.

The provisions of Art. 5, para. 4 about the withdrawal limitation for pension account holders having exceeded age 50 shall apply by analogy regarding the pledge pursuant to Art.8, para 2 WEFV.

Regulatory and legal provisions apply.
