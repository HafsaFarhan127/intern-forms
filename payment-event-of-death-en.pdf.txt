Payment of vested benefits assets in the event of death 
Order of beneficiaries 
In the event of death, vested benefits are paid out according to the order of beneficiaries laid down in law (Art. 15 OLP/FZV). Retirement savings do 
not constitute an inheritance claim and are therefore not part of the estate. 
The groups are prioritized in the following order. This means that e.g., persons in Group 2 will only receive capital if persons in Group 1 do not exist. 
If there are multiple beneficiaries in the same Group, capital is divided up equally between them. 
Group 1: the surviving spouse or registered partner; under-age children; children with a full IV pension or in education up to the maximum age of 
25; divorced spouse 
Group 2: the person who cohabited with the deceased for an uninterrupted period of five years until their death; persons who must provide for the 
maintenance of one or more mutual children; natural persons who were receiving considerable financial support from the deceased pension account 
holder 
Group 3: children of full age who do not meet the conditions listed in Group 1 or, in their absence the parents, or in their absence the siblings 
Group 4: other legal heirs (according to the certificate of inheritance), excluding any payments due to the state or municipal institutions
